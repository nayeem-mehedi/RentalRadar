The rent does not include utilities. You would pay 1/3 of the utilities for the townhouse ground-floor apartment. It is located in a private laneway and there is a park across the street. The neighbourhood is extremely quiet and friendly. It is close to grocery stores, the subway, buses, a library, Casa Loma, George Brown College, and the University of Toronto. Christie Pits is also close by. Pictures and video are available upon request.
